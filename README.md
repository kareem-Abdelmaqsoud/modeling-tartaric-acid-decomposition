This repository includes Jupyter notebooks to showcase the code to fit two models to experimental data about the enantiospecific dehydrogenation of tartaric acid over chiral copper surfaces. 
Enantiospecific heterogeneous catalysis utilizes chiral catalytic surfaces to impart different reaction kinetics to two adsorbed enantiomers, thereby enabling the reactive purification of one 
enantiomer with respect to the other. Intrinsically chiral surfaces with different crystallographic orientations exhibit surface structures which result in enantiospecific reaction kinetics. 
This work models the enantiospecific decomposition kinetics of tartaric acid (TA) on Cu〖(hkl)〗^(R/S) surfaces as a function of surface orientation. The complementary experimental data was 
collected using curved single crystal samples that allow concurrent measurement of TA decomposition kinetics on hundreds of surfaces spanning continuous regions of surface orientation space. 
The goal of this work is to build models to understand what makes one surface orientation more enantiospecific than another and to predict the surface orientation that has the highest 
enantiospecificity. Two models were built for this purpose: the first utilizes Generalized Coordination Number (GCN) features to correlate the surface structure with observed 
enantiospecificity, while the second employs an expansion using chiral cubic harmonic functions as a basis set to approximate enantiospecific behavior.
